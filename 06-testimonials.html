<h1>Testimonials</h1>

  <p>We are always happy to hear about interesting projects that use preCICE. Please <a href="../resources/#contact">write us</a> about your project!</p>
  
  
  <h2>Fluid-Structure-Acoustics Interaction with OpenFOAM and deal.II</h2>
  <div class="testimonial_content">
     <div>
     The LSM group at the University of Siegen is currently developing different adapter codes to run partitioned simulations with preCICE. In a first step, we have coupled an in-house code of deal.II and foam-extend to simulate conjugate heat transfers. In a next step, we have coupled an extended version of a deal.II code for solid mechanics and a foam-extend code for fluid mechanics to run FSI simulations using an ALE approach. Here, the foam-extend code is based on the pimpleDyMFoam solver to capture the mesh movement. We are currently looking forward to extend the FSI coupling with acoustics. preCICE offers sophisticated post-processing methods, which successfully accelerated the convergence of our implicit coupling methods and stabilized the whole coupled system. Also, the possible use of peer-to-peer communications in case of parallel simulations was a reason for us to choose preCICE as coupling library.

  <h2>Fluid-Structure Interaction Modelling of Biomimetics</h2>
  <div class="testimonial_content">
     <div>CFD & FSI-RG at University of Strathclyde UK is a Computational Fluid Dynamics & Computational Structural Dynamics research group. Particular interests focus on the investigation for marine renewable energy devices, biomimetics and offshore fluid-structure-interaction research using numerical modelling methods. One of the numerical approaches we are currently using is to integrate our in-house CFD solver with the open-source structural analysis code CalculiX via preCICE, a coupling library for partitioned multi-physics simulations. At this stage, the coupling is successfully implemented with an explicit scheme, which demonstrates that preCICE has potential advantages in data mapping techniques. We selected preCICE not only because of the high-level API features and the advanced coupling techniques, but more importantly, because the preCICE team is always helpful in providing relevant support. We are looking forward to further close collaboration with the preCICE developers in our research for marine bio-inspired and offshore ocean engineering applications.

  <h2>Exascale Simulation of Fluid-Structure-Acoustics Interaction</h2>
  <div class="testimonial_content">
     <div>At TU Darmstadt we are interested in engineering applications that involve coupled fluid-structure problems, as well as aeroacoustics. Our research focuses on the development of our CFD/CAA solver FASTEST, which we couple via preCICE to the structural solver FEAP, and to the generic solver Ateles for an acoustic far-field. preCICE is particularly well-equipped for cutting-edge research: it is highly customizable to specific setups, it has a comprehensive debugging output that lets you find errors fast, and it offers high scalability that ensures applicability to large problems in future years. Especially important for us is the availability of advanced coupling schemes and post-processing methods. Over the several years of cooperation with the preCICE developers we have learned to appreciate their quick and competent response to support and feature requests.

  <h2>Evaluation of Heart Valve Biomechanics</h2>
  <div class="testimonial_content">
<img src="../assets/testimonial_kyle.JPG">
     <div>We are performing research into the design of artificial heart valves, by using experimental and numerical techniques. We are currently using preCICE to couple OpenFOAM (FOAM-Extend, self-written adapter with immersed boundary approach)  and CalculiX (official adapter) to perform numerical simulations of the opening and closing of heart valves. We are using preCICE as it can handle numerical simulations of large sizes with ease as opposed to previous in-house couplers. Furthermore, the quick and efficient coupling techniques reduce our simulation time significantly.

  <h2>FSI Simulations of High Impact Loads on Structures</h2>
   <div class="testimonial_content">
   <img src="../assets/testimonial_vinhtan.png">
   <div>Understanding high energetic explosive impact loads on structures is fundamental in risk assessment and development of mitigation plans. Using preCICE as a coupling platform, we successfully coupled our in-house unstructured compressible flow solver (muSICS) with an opensource structural FEM solver (CalculiX). Acting as a plug-in to existing solvers, preCICE provided a very efficient coupling mechanism for fluid-structure interaction applications. Collaborating with the developer from preCICE team has been instrumental for us to further develop our inhouse capability for this type of simulation platform. We would continue and look forward to our collaboration with the preCICE team for future applications. <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0734743X15000172">Learn more</a>
