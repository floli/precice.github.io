At TU Darmstadt we are interested in engineering applications that involve coupled fluid-structure problems, as well as aeroacoustics.
Our research focuses on the development of our CFD/CAA solver FASTEST, which we couple via preCICE to the structural solver FEAP, and to the generic solver Ateles for an acoustic far-field.
preCICE is particularly well-equipped for cutting-edge research: it is highly customizable to specific setups, it has a comprehensive debugging output that lets you find errors fast, and it offers high scalability that ensures applicability to large problems in future years.
Especially important for us is the availability of advanced coupling schemes and post-processing methods.
Over the several years of cooperation with the preCICE developers we have learned to appreciate their quick and competent response to support and feature requests.
