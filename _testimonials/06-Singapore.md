Understanding high energetic explosive impact loads on structures is fundamental in risk assessment and development of mitigation plans.
Using preCICE as a coupling platform, we successfully coupled our in-house unstructured compressible flow solver (muSICS) with an opensource structural FEM solver (CalculiX).
Acting as a plug-in to existing solvers, preCICE provided a very efficient coupling mechanism for fluid-structure interaction applications.
Collaborating with the developer from preCICE team has been instrumental for us to further develop our inhouse capability for this type of simulation platform.
We would continue and look forward to our collaboration with the preCICE team for future applications.
