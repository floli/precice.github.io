The project FLEXCFD aims to upgrade our in-house developed aerodynamic solver in order to simulate unsteady configurations with flexible surfaces in relative motion.
Our main objective is to simulate dynamic fluid-structure interaction, with fluid and structural solvers synchronized by a partitioned approach.
We foresee aeronautic applications, such as flexible aircrafts and rotorcrafts.
We choose preCICE for several reasons: the open source environment, availability of non-linear structural dynamics, the possibility to test both explicit and implicit coupling, and the numerous already implemented interpolation and exchange methods for forces and deformations.
