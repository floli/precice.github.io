CFD & FSI-RG at University of Strathclyde UK is a Computational Fluid Dynamics & Computational Structural Dynamics research group.
Particular interests focus on the investigation for marine renewable energy devices, biomimetics and offshore fluid-structure-interaction research using numerical modelling methods.
One of the numerical approaches we are currently using is to integrate our in-house CFD solver with the open-source structural analysis code CalculiX via preCICE, a coupling library for partitioned multi-physics simulations.
At this stage, the coupling is successfully implemented with an explicit scheme, which demonstrates that preCICE has potential advantages in data mapping techniques.
We selected preCICE not only because of the high-level API features and the advanced coupling techniques, but more importantly, because the preCICE team is always helpful in providing relevant support.
We are looking forward to further close collaboration with the preCICE developers in our research for marine bio-inspired and offshore ocean engineering applications.
