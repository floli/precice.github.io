DHCAE Tools provides services to support companies and universities for the implementation of open-source solver technology. Beside this, DHCAE Tools offers calculation services for flow applications, whereby fluid-structure applications are a long-standing field of activity with commercial solvers as well as with self-developed couplings. Due to preCICE's outstanding capabilities, the setup of a coupling between OpenFOAM and CalculiX is now supported by DHCAE Tools in the graphical interface CastNet. This simplifies the mesh generation, the case setup for both OpenFOAM and CalculiX, the definition of the coupling parameters and finally the monitoring of the simulation.
