# preCICE Workshop 2020

**Save the date!** February 17-18, 2020 at the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/nc/en/), [Department of Informatics](http://www.in.tum.de/en/) (campus Garching), [Lecture Hall 2](https://portal.mytum.de/campus/roomfinder/roomfinder_viewmap?mapid=142&roomid=00.04.011@5604).

After meeting you at invited sessions in conferences around Europe,
it is time that we meet at home, where everything started.

In the two (core) days of the Workshop, we plan to have talks by users and developers
of preCICE, presenting challenging applications, latest features, as well as the foundations.

## Preliminary schedule

The following is a rough preliminary schedule for the workshop. The main part of the workshop stretches between Monday noon to Tuesday noon. However, we also plan additional events directly before and after the conference.

If you are in Munich the day before, join us for a social event on Sunday. (optional, TBA)

This is an academic, non-profit conference. However, we still have to collect a small registration fee.

For early registrations (until November 29), the registration fee is 100€, which covers the catering and the workshop dinner. A later registration (until February 7) is also possible, with a registration fee of 150€.

Please use the [registration form](https://www5.in.tum.de/workshops/precice-workshop/) to register.

## Call for contributions

We are aiming for 8-12 contributed talks of 15-25min each, focused more on coupling / preCICE-specific aspects and less on the scientific background of applications. We will notify you about acceptance until December 15.

Please note that this is not a classical scientific conference, but a user and developer meeting. Contributions are very welcome, if they fit the purpose, but not mandatory.

Possible contributions include (non-exclusively):

*  New adapters for community codes
*  Coupling numerics
*  Comparison of different mapping, coupling, and communication methods
*  Coupling boundary conditions
*  Multi-scale coupling
*  Building, packaging, testing, documentation and other Research Software Engineering topics

Please use the [registration form](https://www5.in.tum.de/workshops/precice-workshop/) if you would like to submit a talk.

## Getting there

The TUM campus Garching is well connected to the Munich airport (MUC), as well as to the city center and central station. You can reach it using the subway line U6 (station Garching-Forschungszentrum). Have a look at the [Directions page of TUM](https://www.tum.de/en/about-tum/contact-directions/) for more.

We would be very happy if you could choose a train or other environmentally-friendly ways to come to Munich. Please avoid flying!

## Accommodation

We have reserved a limited number of rooms for you at the hotel (TBA) for the price of (TBA) per night, including breakfast. We recommend this offer, as this very good, bavarian-style hotel is very close to the workshop venue and to the restaurant where we will host the invited dinner. It is also very well connected to the city center.

Please use the code (TBA) when booking.
