# preCICE Workshop 2020

**Save the date!** February 17-18, 2020 at the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/nc/en/), [Department of Informatics](http://www.in.tum.de/en/) (campus Garching), [Lecture Hall 2](https://portal.mytum.de/campus/roomfinder/roomfinder_viewmap?mapid=142&roomid=00.04.011@5604).

After meeting you at invited sessions in conferences around Europe,
it is time that we meet at home, where everything started.

In the two (core) days of the Workshop, we plan to have talks by users and developers
of preCICE, presenting challenging applications, latest features, as well as the foundations.

This is an academic, non-profit conference. However, we still have to collect a small registration fee. Details will be announced later this year and announced to our [mailing list](https://mailman.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/mailman/listinfo/precice).

## Getting there

The TUM campus Garching is well connected to the Munich airport (MUC), as well as to the city center and central station. You can reach it using the subway line U6 (station Garching-Forschungszentrum). Have a look at the [Directions page of TUM](https://www.tum.de/en/about-tum/contact-directions/) for more.

We would be very happy if you could choose a train or other environmentally-friendly ways to come to Munich. Please avoid flying!

We are preparing a list of recommended hotels, which will be available later this year and announced to our [mailing list](https://mailman.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/mailman/listinfo/precice).
