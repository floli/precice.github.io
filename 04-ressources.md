## Documentation & Support
The [Wiki](https://github.com/precice/precice/wiki) contains generell information, e.g. about building, parallization, coding conventions, ...

[Source Code documentation](https://ipvs.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/sgs/precice/doc/) is auto-generated for some branches from time to time.

For asking questions there is a [mailing list](https://mailman.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/mailman/listinfo/precice), you should subscribe when using preCICE.

## Tutorial
There is a tutorial that uses a simple one-dimensional example case. It can be [found in the Wiki](https://github.com/precice/precice/wiki/1D_Example).

The tutorial explains the basic concepts of using PreCICE to couple two functionally independent solvers to compute the solution to a fluid-structure interaction problem. The test case is a simple one-dimensional flow through a deformable artery.
